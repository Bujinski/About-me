    <p><h1>I am originally from Belarus, with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Physiotherapy, from Belarusian State University of Physical Training. While I am a Russian native speaker, I have sharpened my English skills since relocating to USA in 2016. Currently I am working as a dental assistant and l have been in this field for 4 years. For the last 2 years I have collected all required prerequisites for dental hygiene school, but after covid I have changed my mind. I have always admired the tech industry and finally decided to change my career path into this field.<h1></p>
